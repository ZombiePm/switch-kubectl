Description: Fast kubeconfig context switcher with optional Vault integration
 switch-kubectl provides two commands for managing multiple kubeconfig files:
 .
 switch-kubectl — switches between local kubeconfig files stored as
 ~/.kube/config.<context-name>. On switch the current config is saved
 by its context name and the selected one becomes active.
 .
 vswitch-kubectl — same workflow but kubeconfigs are stored in
 HashiCorp Vault (secret/kube/<name>) instead of local files.
 Supports listing, switching by number or partial name, and
 bulk-uploading local configs into Vault.
